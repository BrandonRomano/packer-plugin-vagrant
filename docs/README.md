# Vagrant Plugin

The Vagrant plugin integrates Packer with HashiCorp [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/), allowing you to use Packer to create development boxes.

- [vagrant builder](/docs/builders/vagrant.mdx) - The Vagrant builder is intended for building new boxes from already-existing boxes.

- [vagrant post-processor](/docs/post-processors/vagrant.mdx) - The Packer Vagrant post-processor takes a build and converts the artifact into a valid Vagrant box.

- [vagrant-cloud post-processor](/docs/post-processors/vagrant-cloud.mdx) - The Vagrant Cloud post-processor enables the upload of Vagrant boxes to Vagrant Cloud.
